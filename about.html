			<h3>Organizational Profile</h3>
			<p>
				What can a closely knit group of town mates, classmates, playmates, relatives and drinking
				buddies- all rolled into one, do to leave some meaningful legacy in their native town? What
				worthwhile project can this unique group undertake to acknowledge the goodness of the
				Creator now that they have tasted some success? How can they share their blessings now that
				they are in the advanced years of their careers? This burden weighed somehow in the hearts
				and minds of each individual in the group.<br><br>
				During one occasion where everyone met after having rarely seen each other for a decade or
				so, the excited conversation drifted into going home to San Fernando to bond with other some
				more, to rekindle ties, to reminisce the nostalgic past and to bring cheers to those friends who
				remained in the town. Carrying the same burden in their hearts, everyone agreed that a
				medical and dental mission would be the best motivation for the homecoming. The group will
				now please the people and hopefully God, instead of themselves. They will be happier making
				others happy.<br><br>
				The project demanded commitment. Everyone sold himself out to it. Thus, the birth of the first
				medical mission.<br><br>
				The success of the first medical and dental mission, as if an unseen hand never allowed it to fail,
				convinced everyone that the mission should continue, the vision clearly cast and pursued.
				Hence, the group decided to continue to carry the burden, to continue with the mission,
				organizing themselves into a registered foundation. The purpose and scope to expand to
				providing livelihood, funding scholarships, giving material aid and sustaining the environment.
				The aim is to help people help themselves and enable them to maintain a sustainable living.<br><br>
				With the vision and mission in hearts and mind, the San Fernando Economic Development
				Foundation was born on January 21, 2015, incorporated under existing Philippine law.
				Henceforth, yearly medical missions will be conducted, the scholarship program will be started,
				training and seminars on livelihood projects will be held and start-up funding will be made
				available, tree planting, reforestation and environmental clean-up to follow suit.<br><br><br>
				These programs will need big funding. To fill this need, donations from individuals, foreign
				donors, private corporations, government institutions, donor foundations and the like will be
				actively sought. Activities and programs will be published in SFEDFI website together with
				regular report on project status and costs. Annual financial statement shall be made available
				to those interested.
